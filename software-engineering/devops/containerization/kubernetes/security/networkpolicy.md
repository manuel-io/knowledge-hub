# NetworkPolicy

NetworkPolicy is an object to configure ingress and egress traffic rules.

{% hint style="info" %}
Incoming traffic is called ingress. Outgoing traffic is called egress.
{% endhint %}

By default Kubernetes is configured with an "All Allow" rule that allows traffic from any pod to any other pod or services within the cluster.

But sometimes it's required to block communication between specific pods. Example:

* Only allow traffic to the database from the API server but not from the web application

## YAML Config

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata: 
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db                    # Pod for which network policy should be applied
  policyTypes:                    # Only Ingress traffic is restricted
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:                         
    - podSelector:                # Allow traffic by labeled Pod "api-pod"
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod
    - namespaceSelector:          # Or allow traffic from namespace "prod"
        matchLabels:
          name: prod              
    ports:                        # Ports to allow traffic on
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306               
```

In order to use AND logic in the selectors remove the list within `from`:

```
...
  ingress:
  - from:                         
    - podSelector:                # Only allow traffic by labeled Pod "api-pod"
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod
      namespaceSelector:          # AND from namespace "prod"
        matchLabels:
          name: prod              
...
```

To define both ingress and egress rules:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata: 
  name: db-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db                    # Pod for which network policy should be applied
  policyTypes:                    # Restrict Ingress and Egress traffic
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:                         
    - podSelector:                # Allow traffic by labeled Pod "api-pod"
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod           
    ports:                        # Ports to allow traffic on
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306  
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:                # Only allow egress traffic to pods labeled api-pod 
        matchLabels:
          name: api-pod 
```
