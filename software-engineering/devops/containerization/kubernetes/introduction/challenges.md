# Challenges

1. Challenges in Managing Containers and Distributed Applications:
   * Managing containers at scale and architecting distributed applications based on microservices' principles is challenging.
2. Requirements for Container Management:
   * Continuous integration pipeline is needed to build, test, and verify container images.
   * A cluster of machines serves as the base infrastructure for running containers.
   * A system is required to launch containers and monitor them for failures and self-healing.
   * Rolling updates, rollbacks, and resource teardown capabilities are necessary.
3. Network and Storage Considerations:
   * Flexible, scalable, and easy-to-manage network and storage solutions are crucial.
   * Containers launched on worker nodes need to be connected to other containers securely.
   * Storage structure should provide seamless storage provisioning, retention, or recycling.
